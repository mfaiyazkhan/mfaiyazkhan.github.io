I am Faiyaz. I graduated from the [department of CSE, SUST](https://www.sust.edu/d/cse). I am currently working as a full-stack software developer at [Therap (BD) Ltd.](https://therapbd.com/) It is a US-based software company that helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by providing Software as a Service (SaaS) to government and private organizations globally. Apart from building helpful systems, I am also passionate about research. My research interests include the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and of course, Software Engineering. 

Apart from my work, I like reading books, traveling, and have a fair share of interest in playing sports, including cricket, football, and table tennis.

Research Experience
======
My undergraduate thesis was under [Md Saiful Islam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tQT0OSAAAAAJ&hl=en). We explored the topic of Bangla Image Captioning. As one of the early research efforts in this field, we believed that there wasn't a good multimodal dataset available for the language and so expanded one of the most widely used datasets in English to create a human annotated dataset. We analyzed the data both quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating the value of a multimodal, multilingual dataset for tasks likee Image Captioning and Machine Translation. The work is Published in the [Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.740/).

I competed in the [Constraint@AAAI2021 - COVID19 Fake News Detection in English](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26655) where we approached the fake news detection problem of the social media by using an ensemble of transformer-based pre-trained models. We placed 20th among 167 teams. The preprint of the work is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12027)

Work Experience
======
I've been employed at [Therap (BD) Ltd.](https://therapbd.com/) for the last three years as a full-stack software developer. I regularly work with the Java Spring framework, Hibernate, Relational Database Management System, and JSP-Servlets as part of my technological stack. During my time there, I worked on several projects where I developed effective solutions to important business problems. In addition to my regular duties, I contribute with the organization's new developer training program by mentoring them.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
